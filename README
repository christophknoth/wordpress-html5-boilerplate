Adaptation of the [html5-boilerplate project] https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate/ 
on github. This project users html5-boilerplate as a foundation and is adapted for WordPress
and builds the free [toolbox theme] http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/toolbox.

Toolbox is a semantic, HTML5, canvas for CSS artists and an ultra-minimal set of super-clean
templates for your own WordPress theme development.

wordpress-html5-boilerplate will take the Toolbox theme let you develop it and when you are ready
to see it in Wordpress run <code>ant minify</code> and it will take the publish folder and move
it to your WordPress theme directory with all the html5-boilerplate goodness applied.
